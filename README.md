## XOR Encryption

This is a basic C++ program that demonstrates a simple symmetric encryption algorithm using the XOR cipher with a repeating key.

The core principle is that applying the same XOR operation with the same key to a piece of data twice will restore the original data.
(Data XOR Key) XOR Key = Data

This means the same XOR function can be used for both encryption and decryption.
